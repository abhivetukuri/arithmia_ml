# ML Technical Analysis on Arrhythmia Datasets

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning analysis on two key datasets related to arrhythmia: the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The analysis is structured as follows:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Initial exploration and visualization of datasets.
- Understanding dataset characteristics.

## Data Balancing
- Implementing resampling techniques to address class imbalance.

## Machine Learning Model Implementation
- **MIT-BIH Dataset**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, and XGBoost models.
- **PTB Dataset**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for deep learning approach.

## Results and Evaluation
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Detailed analysis with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

The notebook provides a detailed methodology and findings for the machine learning analysis on arrhythmia datasets.
